# Predicting-Pollution-Filter
This project uses a deep learning time-series approach to predict future pollution, and then discover a necessary filter for HVAC systems.

Our code is spread across multiple files

To follow it in order, start with the preprocessing file which accesses the raw data. Then move to the time-series prediction. Using the output file from there,
move to the averaging file, and finally move to the filter reccomendation file
